This script collects entries as they're posted in a Hunger Games thread and enters them into the simulator for you.

Works in Firefox, Chrome/Chromium, and Opera, with or without 4chan X. Not tested in anything else. Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
#

# Installation
### Firefox
Install the [Tampermonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) extension, click **[here](https://github.com/zmnmxlntr/hg/raw/master/hg.user.js)**, then click "Install".
<br/>*NOTE: It is recommended to use Tampermonkey rather than Greasemonkey, as the latter is currently bugged.*
#

### Chrome/Chromium
Install the [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) extension, click **[here](https://github.com/zmnmxlntr/hg/raw/master/hg.user.js)**, then click "Install".

### Opera

Doesn't seem to work on Safari. If you can't bear using a superior browser, let me know as much and I'll look into it.

# Usage
To draw input fields, press F1 (or F4 for Chrome plebs) or scroll to the bottom of the page and click "Draw". To hide input fields, press F2 (they will not be lost, only hidden). Works nicely alongside automatic page updates - just press F1 (or F4) or click the "Draw" button again to add input fields to new posts (previously existing ones will not be lost/overwritten). Only posts with images will have input fields drawn.

All tributes are selected by default; to exclude a post as a tribute, deselect the checkbox in the top-left corner of its post. Tribute name text fields generate what the script thinks the poster is going for, strips invalid characters, and truncates to the maximum length of characters. To change a tribute's name, simply edit the text field. The radio buttons to the right of the text field are for selecting the tribute's gender, which defaults to male.

To save the tributes, scroll to the bottom of the page and use the radio buttons to select the number of tributes to be entered. There is no need to deselect excess tributes; they will be ignored. Press the "Save" button.

On the Brantsteele Hunger Games simulator's "Edit Cast" page, press the "Load" button at the top-left corner of the page.

There are ~~a few~~ several additions to the script that aren't visible in the demo gif. I'm sure you can figure out what they do. If you can't, contact me.
